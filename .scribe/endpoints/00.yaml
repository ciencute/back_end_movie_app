Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas''s next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008\u20132014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history''s most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","gender":"Male","favoriteCount":113},{"id":2,"name":"Mark Hamill","img":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/t\/p\/w600_and_h900_bestv2\/ilPBHd3r3ahlipNQtjr4E3G04jJ.jpg","slug":"mark-hamill","detail":"Mark Richard Hamill (born September 25, 1951) is an American actor, voice artist, producer, director, and writer.

Fonda cultivated a strong, appealing screen image in several films now considered to be classics, earning one Academy Award for Best Actor on two nominations.\n\nFonda made his mark early as a Broadway actor and made his Hollywood film debut in 1935. His film career began to gain momentum with roles such as Bette Davis''s fiancee in her Academy Award-winning performance in Jezebel (1938), brother Frank in Jesse James (1939), and the future President in Young Mr. Lincoln (1939), directed by John Ford. His early career peaked with his Academy Award-nominated performance as Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, about an Oklahoma family who moved to California during the Dust Bowl 1930s. This film is widely considered to be among the greatest American films.\n\nIn 1941 he starred opposite Barbara Stanwyck in the screwball comedy classic The Lady Eve. Book-ending his service in WWII were his starring roles in two highly regarded westerns: The Ox-Bow Incident (1943) and My Darling Clementine (1946), the latter directed by John Ford, and he also starred in Ford''s western Fort Apache (1948). After a seven-year break from films, during which Fonda focused on stage productions, he returned with the WWII war-boat ensemble Mister Roberts (1955). In 1957 he starred as Juror No.8, the hold-out juror, in 12 Angry Men. Fonda, who was also co-producer, won the BAFTA for Best Foreign Actor.\n\nLater in his career, Fonda moved into darker roles, such as the villain in the epic Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), underrated and a box office disappointment at its time of release, but now regarded as one of the best westerns of all time. He also played in lighter-hearted fare such as Yours, Mine and Ours with Lucille Ball, but also often played important military figures, such as a Colonel in Battle of the Bulge (1965), and Admiral Nimitz in Midway (1976). He finally won the Academy Award for Best Actor at the 54th Academy Awards for his final film role in On Golden Pond (1981), which also starred Katharine Hepburn and his daughter Jane Fonda, but was too ill to attend the ceremony. He died from heart disease a few months later.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Henry Fonda, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","gender":"Male","favoriteCount":149},{"id":1810,"name":"Heath Ledger","img":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/t\/p\/w600_and_h900_bestv2\/ilPBHd3r3ahlipNQtjr4E3G04jJ.jpg","slug":"heath-ledger","detail":"Heath Andrew Ledger (4 April 1979 \u2013 22 January 2008) was an Australian actor and music video director.

He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.\n\nFor his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in Brokeback Mountain, Ledger won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor and the Best International Actor Award from the Australian Film Institute; he was the first actor to win the latter award posthumously. He was nominated for the BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Actor, becoming the eighth-youngest nominee in the category at that time. Posthumously, he shared the 2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award with the rest of the ensemble cast, the director, and the casting director for the film I''m Not There, which was inspired by the life and songs of American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In the film, Ledger portrayed a fictional actor named Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Dylan''s life and persona.\n\nLedger died on 22 January 2008 as a result of an accidental overdose of medications. A few months before his death, Ledger had finished filming his role as the Joker in The Dark Knight. At the time of his death, The Dark Knight was in post-production, and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, in which he was playing his last role as Tony, was in the midst of filming.

Lucas is known for creating the Star Wars and Indiana Jones franchises and founding Lucasfilm, LucasArts and Industrial Light & Magic. He served as chairman of Lucasfilm before selling it to The Walt Disney Company in 2012.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Southern California in 1967, Lucas co-founded American Zoetrope with filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. Lucas wrote and directed THX 1138 (1971), based on his earlier student short Electronic Labyrinth: THX 1138 4EB, which was a critical success but a financial failure. His next work as a writer-director was the film American Graffiti (1973), inspired by his youth in early 1960s Modesto, California, and produced through the newly founded Lucasfilm. The film was critically and commercially successful, and received five Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.\n\nLucas''s next film, the epic space opera Star Wars (1977), had a troubled production but was a surprise hit, becoming the highest-grossing film at the time, winning six Academy Awards and sparking a cultural phenomenon. Lucas produced and co-wrote the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). With director Steven Spielberg, he created, produced and co-wrote the Indiana Jones films Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Temple of Doom (1984), The Last Crusade (1989) and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). He also produced and wrote a variety of films and television series through Lucasfilm between the 1970s and the 2010s.\n\nIn 1997, Lucas rereleased the Star Wars trilogy as part of a special edition featuring several alterations; home media versions with further changes were released in 2004 and 2011. He returned to directing with a Star Wars prequel trilogy comprising The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). He last collaborated on the CGI-animated television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008\u20132014, 2020), the war film Red Tails (2012), and the CGI film Strange Magic (2015).\n\nLucas is one of history''s most financially successful filmmakers and has been nominated for four Academy Awards. His films are among the 100 highest-grossing movies at the North American box office, adjusted for ticket-price inflation. Lucas is considered a significant figure of the 20th-century New Hollywood movement.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article George Lucas, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","gender":"Male","favoriteCount":113},{"id":2,"name":"Mark Hamill","img":"https:\/\/www.themoviedb.org\/t\/p\/w600_and_h900_bestv2\/ilPBHd3r3ahlipNQtjr4E3G04jJ.jpg","slug":"mark-hamill","detail":"Mark Richard Hamill (born September 25, 1951) is an American actor, voice artist, producer, director, and writer.

Though Zemeckis has often been pigeonholed as a director interested only in effects, his work has been defended by several critics, including David Thomson, who wrote that \"No other contemporary director has used special effects to more dramatic and narrative purpose.\"","gender":"Male","favoriteCount":79}],"first_page_url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=1","from":1,"last_page":765,"last_page_url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=765","links":[{"url":null,"label":"&laquo; Previous","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=1","label":"1","active":true},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=2","label":"2","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=3","label":"3","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=4","label":"4","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=5","label":"5","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=6","label":"6","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=7","label":"7","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=8","label":"8","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=9","label":"9","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=10","label":"10","active":false},{"url":null,"label":"...","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=764","label":"764","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=765","label":"765","active":false},{"url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=2","label":"Next &raquo;","active":false}],"next_page_url":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors?page=2","path":"http:\/\/movieapp.cf\/api\/user\/actors","per_page":10,"prev_page_url":null,"to":10,"total":7646}'
